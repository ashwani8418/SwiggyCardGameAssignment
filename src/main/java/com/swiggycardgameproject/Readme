To run this Game, Go to the Main class and run the main class to start the game.
The line MultiPlayerGame game = new MultiPlayerGame(player) in the Main class is creating a new instance of the MultiPlayerGame class and assigning it to the 
variable game. The constructor of the MultiPlayerGame class takes a Player object as a parameter.

Once the game object has been created, it can be used to start the game by calling a method on it.
For example, if the MultiPlayerGame class has a method called startGame(), you could call it like this: game.playGame();

>>>>>>>>MultiPlayerGame Class 
The dealCard() method returns the top card from the deck, and increments the top index to keep track of which card was dealt last. 

*********************In Deck Class

The Deck class represents a deck of playing cards. It contains an array of Card objects representing each card in the deck, and methods for shuffling the deck and 
drawing cards from the deck.

The constructor of the Deck class initializes the deck by creating a new array of Card objects with a size of 52, and then populating it with cards of each suit and
rank.

The shuffleCard method shuffles the cards in the deck using a random number generator to swap pairs of cards at random positions in the deck. After shuffling, the 
topIndex variable is reset to 0 to indicate that the deck is freshly shuffled and ready to deal.

The drawCard method returns the next card in the deck, starting from the top of the deck (i.e., the first card). It does this by returning the card at the current 
topIndex position, and then incrementing topIndex to point to the next card in the deck. If topIndex is equal to or greater than the size of the deck, the method 
returns null, indicating that the deck is empty and no more cards can be drawn.
The drawCardFromDeck() method draw card to the player hand.

The isGameDraw() is boolean type and used to check deck Pile is empty or not. It returns true or False;

******************In Card

This code defines a Card class that represents a playing card with a rank and suit. It uses a Java 16 feature called record, which is a concise way to declare classes 
that are primarily used to hold data.

The Card class has two fields, a Rank and a Suit, which are passed to the constructor when creating a new Card object.

The toString method is overridden to provide a human-readable string representation of the card, which concatenates the name of the rank and suit. 
It returns a string in the format "rank of suit", such as "Ace of Spades".

This Card class can be used as a component of a larger card game project, where it can be utilized by other classes representing the deck of cards, hands of players, 
and so on.
