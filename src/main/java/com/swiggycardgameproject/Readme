To run this Game, in Main class
The line MultiPlayerGame game = new MultiPlayerGame(player) in the Main class is creating a new instance of the MultiPlayerGame class and assigning it to the 
variable game. The constructor of the MultiPlayerGame class takes a Player object as a parameter.

Once the game object has been created, it can be used to start the game by calling a method on it.
For example, if the MultiPlayerGame class has a method called startGame(), you could call it like this: game.playGame();
